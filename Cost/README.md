## Introduction

This repository contains documentation and code in the format of hands-on labs to help you learn, measure, and build using architectural best practices.

For more information about cost optimization on AWS visit the Well-Architected tool in the AWS console, and read the AWS Well-Architected cost optimization whitepaper.

## Labs:

### Cost Fundamentals
These labs must be done in order from 1 to 5, starting at the 100 level labs.

These labs are designed to start you on your Cost Optimization journey. They cover the required steps to enable your account and the features within it for Cost Optimization. They also focus on addressing the core areas of the Well-Architected Cost Optimization pillar, with simple but effective exercises.
