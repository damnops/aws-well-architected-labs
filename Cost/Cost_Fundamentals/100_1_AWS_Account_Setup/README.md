# Level 100: AWS Account Setup
http://wellarchitectedlabs.com 

## Introduction
 This hands-on lab will guide you through the steps to create and setup an initial account structure, and enable access to billing reports. This will ensure that you can complete the Well-Architected Cost workshops, and enable you to optimize your workloads inline with the Well-Architected Framework.
 

## Goals
- Implement an account structure
- Configure billing services


## Prerequisites
- Multiple AWS accounts (at least two) 
- Root user access to the master account


## Permissions required
- Root user access to the master account
- [./Code/master_policy](./Code/master_policy.md) IAM policy required for Master account user
- [./Code/member_policy](./Code/member_policy.md) IAM policy required for Member account user 
- NOTE: There may be permission error messages during the lab, as the console may require additional privileges. These errors will not impact the lab, and we follow security best practices by implementing the minimum set of privileges required.
