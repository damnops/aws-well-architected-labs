# Quest: Loft - Introduction to Security

## About this Guide
This quest is the guide for an [AWS Loft](https://aws.amazon.com/start-ups/loft/) Well-Architected Security introduction workshop. You can check your local loft schedule for upcoming Well-Architected events, or you can also run it on your own! The skills you learn will help you secure your workloads in alignment with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).

## Prerequisites:
* An [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) that you are able to use for testing, that is not used for production or other purposes.  
NOTE: You will be billed for any applicable AWS resources used if you complete this lab that are not covered in the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
