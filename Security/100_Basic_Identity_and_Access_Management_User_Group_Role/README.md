# Level 100: Basic Identity and Access Management User, Group, Role

## Introduction
This hands-on lab will guide you through the introductory steps to configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).  
You will use the AWS Management Console to guide you through how to configure your first IAM user, group and role for administrative access. The skills you learn will help you secure your workloads in alignment with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).

## Goals:
* Protecting AWS credentials
* Fine-grained authorization

## Prerequisites:
* An [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) that you are able to use for testing, that is not used for production or other purposes.  
NOTE: You will be billed for any applicable AWS resources used if you complete this lab that are not covered in the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
