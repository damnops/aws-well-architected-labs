## 1. Launch Instance <a name="launch_instance"></a>
You can launch a Linux instance using the AWS Management Console. This tutorial is intended to help you launch your first instance quickly, so it doesn't cover all possible options. For more information about the advanced options, see [Launching an Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launching-instance.html).
Launch an instance:
1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
2. From the console dashboard, choose Launch Instance.
![ec2-launch-wizard](Images/ec2-launch-wizard-button.png)
3. The choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) page displays a list of basic configurations, called Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), that serve as templates for your instance. Select the HVM edition of the Amazon Linux AMI, either version.
![ec2-launch-wizard](Images/ec2-launch-wizard-ami.png)
4. On the Choose an Instance Type page, you can select the hardware configuration of your instance. Select the t2.micro type, which is selected by default. Notice that this instance type is eligible for the free tier. Then select Next: Configure Instance Details.
![ec2-launch-wizard](Images/ec2-launch-wizard-type.png)
5. On the Configure Instance Details page, make the following changes:  
  5.1 Select Create new IAM role.  
  ![ec2-launch-wizard](Images/ec2-launch-wizard-role.png)  
  5.2	In the new tab that opens, select Create role.  
  	![ec2-launch-wizard](Images/ec2-launch-wizard-create-role.png)  
  5.3	With AWS service pre-selected, select EC2 from the top of the list, then click Next: Permissions.  
  	![ec2-launch-wizard](Images/ec2-launch-wizard-create-role-start.png)  
  5.4	Enter `s3` in the search and select AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess from the list of policies, then click
  Next: Review. This policy will give this EC2 instance access to read and list any objects in Amazon
  S3 within your AWS account.  
  	![ec2-launch-wizard](Images/ec2-launch-wizard-create-role-policy.png)  
  5.5	Enter a role name, such as `ec2-s3-read-only-role`, and then click Create role.  
  	![ec2-launch-wizard](Images/ec2-launch-wizard-create-role-name.png)  
  5.6	Back on the EC2 launch web browser tab, select the refresh button next to Create new IAM role,
  and click the role you just created.  
  	![ec2-launch-wizard](Images/ec2-launch-wizard-create-role-final.png)  
  5.7 Scroll down and expand the Advanced Details section. Enter the following in the User Data test box to automatically install Apache web server and apply basic configuration when the instance is launched:  
  	```
	#!/bin/bash
	yum update -y
	yum install -y httpd
	service httpd start
	chkconfig httpd on
	groupadd www
	usermod -a -G www ec2-user
	chown -R root:www /var/www
	chmod 2775 /var/www
	find /var/www -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} +
	find /var/www -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} +
   	```
6. Accept defaults and click **Next: Add tags**.
7. Click **Next: Configure Security Group**.  
	7.1 Accept default opton **Create a new security group**.  
  7.2 On the line of the first default entry *SSH*, select **Source** as *My IP*.  
	7.3 Click **Add Rule**, select Type as *HTTP* and **Source** as *Anywhere*.  
	Note that best practice is to have an Elastic Load Balancer inline or the EC2 instance not directly
  exposed to the internet. However, for simplicity in this lab, we are opening the access to anywhere. Other lab modules
  secure access with Elastic Load Balancer.  
	![Security Group](Images/ec2-launch-wizard-security-group.png)  
	7.5 Click Review and Launch.  
	![ec2-launch-wizard](Images/ec2-launch-wizard-launch.png)  
8. On the Review Instance Launch page, check the details, and then click Launch.
9. If you do not have an existing key pair for access instances, a prompt will appear. Click Create New,
then type a name such as `lab`, click Download Key Pair, and then click Launch Instances.
![ec2-launch-wizard](Images/ec2-launch-wizard-keys.png)
    **Important**

    This is the only chance to save the private key file. You'll need to provide the name of your key
    pair when you launch an instance, and you'll provide the corresponding private key each time you connect
    to the instance.

10. Click View Instances.
11. When your instance is launched, its status will change to running, and it will need a few minutes to apply patches and install Apache web server.
![ec2-status](Images/ec2-status.png)
12. You can connect to the Apache test page by entering the public DNS, which you can find on the description
tab or instances list. Take note of this public DNS value.

## 2. Configure AWS WAF <a name="waf"></a>
Using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), we are going to deploy a basic example
AWS WAF configuration for use with CloudFront.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console, select your preferred region, and open the CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/. Note if your CloudFormation console does not look the same, you can enable the redesigned console by clicking **New Console** in the **CloudFormation** menu.
2. Click **Create stack**.  
![cloudformation-createstack-1](Images/cloudformation-createstack-1.png)  
3. Enter the following **Amazon S3 URL**:  `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-well-architected-labs/Security/Code/waf-global.yaml` and click **Next**.  
![cloudformation-createstack-s3](Images/cloudformation-createstack-s3.png)   
4. Enter the following details:
  * Stack name: The name of this stack. For this lab, use `waf`.
  * WAFName: Enter the base name to be used for resource and export names for this stack. For this lab, you can use `Lab1`.
  * WAFCloudWatchPrefix: Enter the name of the CloudWatch prefix to use for each rule using alphanumeric
  characters only. For this lab, you can use `Lab1`.
  The remainder of the parameters can be left as defaults.
  ![waf-create-stack](Images/waf-create-stack.png)  
5. At the bottom of the page click **Next**.
6. In this lab, we won't add any tags or other options. Click Next. Tags, which are key-value pairs, can help you identify your stacks. For more information, see [Adding Tags to Your AWS CloudFormation Stack](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide//cfn-console-add-tags.html).
7. Review the information for the stack. When you're satisfied with the configuration, click **Create stack**.  
8. After a few minutes the stack status should change from *CREATE_IN_PROGRESS* to *CREATE_COMPLETE*.
10. You have now set up a basic AWS WAF configuration ready for CloudFront to use!


## 3. Configure Amazon CloudFront <a name="cloudfront"></a>
Using the AWS Management Console, we will create a CloudFront distribution, and link it to the AWS WAF
ACL
we previously created.
1. Open the Amazon CloudFront console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home.
2. From the console dashboard, choose Create Distribution.
![cloudfront-create](Images/cloudfront-create-button.png)
3. Click Get Started in the Web section.
![cloudfront-getstarted](Images/cloudfront-get-started.png)
4. Specify the following settings for the distribution:
  * In **Origin Domain Name** enter the EC2 public DNS name you recorded from your instance launch.
  ![cloudfront-create-distribution](Images/cloudfront-create-distribution.png)
  * In the distribution Settings section, click AWS WAF Web ACL, and select the one you created previously.
  ![cloudfront-distribution-settings](Images/cloudfront-distribution-settings.png)
  * Click Create Distrubution.
  * For more information on the other configuration options, see [Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Web Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html) in the CloudFront documentation.
5. After CloudFront creates your distribution, the value of the Status column for your distribution will change from In Progress to Deployed.
![cloudfront-deployed](Images/cloudfront-deployed.png)
6. When your distribution is deployed, confirm that you can access your content using your new CloudFront URL or CNAME. Copy the Domain Name into a web browser to test.
![cloudfront-test](Images/cloudfront-test.png)
For more information, see [Testing a Web Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-testing.html) in the CloudFront documentation.
7. You have now configured Amazon CloudFront with basic settings and AWS WAF.

For more information on configuring CloudFront, see [Viewing and Updating CloudFront Distributions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/HowToUpdateDistribution.html) in the CloudFront documentation.
