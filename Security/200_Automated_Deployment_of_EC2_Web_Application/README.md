# Level 200: Automated Deployment of EC2 Web Application

## Introduction
This hands-on lab will guide you through the steps to configure a web application in [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) with a defense in depth approach. The skills you learn will help you secure your workloads in alignment with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).  
The [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) example [CloudFormation template](Code/wordpress.yaml) will deploy a basic WordPress  content management system, incorporating a number of AWS security best practices. This example is not intended to be a comprehensive WordPress system, please consult [Build a WordPress Website](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-wordpress-website/) for more information.
