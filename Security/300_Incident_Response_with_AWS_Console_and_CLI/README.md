# Level 300: Incident Response with AWS Console and CLI

## Introduction
This hands-on lab will guide you through a number of examples of how you could use the AWS Console and Command Line Interface (CLI) for responding to a security incident. It is a best practice to be prepared for an incident, and have appropriate detective controls enabled. You can find more best practices by reading the [Security Pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.security.en.html).  

The skills you learn will help you secure your workloads in alignment with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).

## Goals:
* Identify tooling for incident response
* Automate containment for incident response
* Pre-deploy tools for incident response

## Prerequisites:

* An IAM user or role in your AWS account.  
NOTE: You will be billed for any applicable AWS resources used if you complete this lab that are not covered in the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
* CloudTrail must already be enabled in your account and logging to CloudWatch Logs, follow the [Automated Deployment of Detective Controls](../200_Automated_Deployment_of_Detective_Controls/README.md) lab to enable.
